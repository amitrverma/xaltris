# What You Get from a Fractional CTO

If you're a founder, a product owner, or an ops lead building something technical — but don't have a dedicated CTO — you're not alone.

Plenty of teams are trying to move fast without the budget (or the need) for a full-time executive.  
But you still need clarity. You still need to make the right architectural calls. And you still need someone who’s seen what breaks — before it breaks.

That’s where fractional CTO support comes in.

---

## So, What Do You Actually Get?

Here’s what you’re buying when you bring in a fractional CTO — at least the way we do it at xaltris:

---

### 1. **Technical Judgment That Saves You Time and Regret**

Not all tech debt is bad. Not all “scalable solutions” are worth it right now.  
We help you choose what matters *now* — and what can wait — so you don't waste cycles over-architecting, or worse, under-building.

---

### 2. **A Clear Product–Tech Bridge**

Your product team has ideas. Your engineers have tickets.  
We help translate ideas into architecture — and blockers into prioritization — so things flow faster and cleaner.

---

### 3. **Code You Can Trust, or Skip Writing Entirely**

Sometimes we’ll review PRs. Sometimes we’ll spike prototypes.  
Sometimes we’ll just tell you, “Don’t build that — use this off-the-shelf thing for now.”

You’re not paying us to code. You’re paying us to know when to.

---

### 4. **Engineering Leadership Without Hiring Pressure**

Hiring a full-time CTO is a commitment.  
With fractional support, you get senior engineering oversight without the long-term lock-in — until you’re truly ready for that role in-house.

We help *stabilize*, *scale*, and *handoff* — cleanly.

---

### 5. **An Outside View That Isn’t Just Another Opinion**

We're not embedded in your org chart. That’s a strength.  
We bring a sharp, external lens — based on actual experience across startups, scaleups, and systems that had to work under pressure.

This isn't agency fluff. It's operator-level support, on demand.

---

## Who Is This For?

- Solo founders who don’t want to wing infra or hiring  
- Product teams struggling to scale their engineering stack  
- CEOs with dev velocity problems and no one to translate why  
- Teams who need a calm voice that knows how to ship

---

## What It’s Not

- A glorified dev lead  
- Just weekly standups and slide decks  
- Endless calls with no code or outcome  
- Another layer of complexity

---

## You Get Speed *and* Stability

You get someone who’s built across domains and roles — someone who can think high-level *and* read the pull request.

You get fewer messes down the line. More clarity up front.

**Want that? Reach out.**  
Let’s figure out what you really need — and skip the rest.
